# Dragon-Grad
A toy deep learning library with full type checking.

# Requirements
numpy==2.0.1

# Usage
Check fizzbuzz.py for an example. The library is pretty simple so it should be straight forward to understand. Currently, the training function can only train sequential models. Custom training functions may be written for more sophisticated architectures.
